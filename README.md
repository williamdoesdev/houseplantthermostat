This Gatsby web app allows users to list all the houseplants they keep in their home and gives recomendations for what temperature their thermostat should be set at in order to optimize growth. It also gives recomendations for relative humidity and lists basic datapoints for each plant such as how often the plant should be fertilized and whether or not it's poisonous.
